# Leetcode Solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the free problems on Leetcode. Since I do not have access to the premium version, the focus is solely on publicly available questions.

## Problem Categories

The solutions cover a wide range of topics, including:
* Arrays
* Strings
* Hash Tables
* Graphs
* And more!

## Language

All solutions are implemented in Python, as I am currently focusing on mastering this language.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help improve the code or add new solutions, feel free to open a Pull Request (PR). Any feedback or suggestions for writing better code are highly appreciated.

Thank you!
